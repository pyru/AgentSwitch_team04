    was correct. Nothing in the code can move a due date back, so the target is picked fresh instead.

    Not late has to hold both ways the agent measures it. `planned_end_date` is compared against the
    pinned AGENT_TODAY, while finite_schedule runs server-side on the real date — an order can sit in
