"""results.json for AgentSwitch's harness runner ("Our harness" -> Submit for a run, Release 8.1).

The runner reads only this file:

    {"tasks": [{"id": "t1", "title": "What it checks", "passed": true, "score": 1.0, "evidence": "short proof"}],
     "summary": "one line"}

passed strictly true or false, score 0-1, 1 to 200 tasks. If the file is missing or malformed when the run ends,
the panel shows no results at all, so every planned task is listed before the first one starts and the file is
rewritten, whole, after every verdict.

Written with Claude (AI-assisted).
