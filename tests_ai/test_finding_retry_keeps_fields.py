"""A refused record_finding must not cost the model the fields it already got right.

Seen live 2026-09-30 on most_overdue_open_why_late. The first attempt carried
contributing_causes ['stopped_without_recorded_reason', 'operation_not_started'] and a cost of
zeroes. The cost guard refused it. The retry set cost to null and rebuilt the rest of the payload
from scratch, dropping contributing_causes, so the finding that persisted was missing a cause the
database proves and the task scored revise. The refusal was meant to improve the answer and made
it worse.

Every guard in record_finding ends with "call record_finding again", so this is a property of all
of them, not of the cost check.
